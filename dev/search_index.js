Combined with gate modifiers, these two are enough to define a universal gate set for quantum computation.\n\nOpenQASM3 also offers a standard library of gates, all defined in terms of the two built-in gates, in stdgates.inc. Quasar.jl provides a copy of stdgates.inc in its test/ directory, which you can import with:\n\ninclude \"stdgates.inc\";\n\nHowever, many quantum computers and simulators have different built-in gates, so-called \"native gates\", which they can implement without reference to gphase or U. You can provide your own built-in gate set to Quasar.jl to ensure that the output circuit instructions are in your \"gate dialect\".\n\nIn Quasar.jl, you can create a function which takes no arguments and returns a Dict{String, BuiltinGateDefinition}. The keys are the names of your built-in gates (e.g. \"msaa\") and a BuiltinGateDefinition has the following fields:\n\nname::String – the name of the gate\narguments::Vector{String} – the names of the gate's arguments, if any (can be empty)\nqubit_targets::Vector{String} – the names of the gate's target(s).\nbody::CircuitInstruction – the single CircuitInstruction which defines the gate\n\nSo, for example, if the Pauli X gate x and the X rotation gate Rx are built-in gates, you could create the function:\n\nmy_builtin_gates() = Dict(\n    \"x\"=>BuiltinGateDefinition(\"x\", String[], [\"a\"], (type=\"x\", arguments=InstructionArgument[], targets=[0], controls=Pair{Int,Int}[], exponent=1.0)), \n    \"rx\"=>BuiltinGateDefinition(\"rx\", [\"θ\"], [\"a\"], (type=\"rx\", arguments=InstructionArgument[θ], targets=[0], controls=Pair{Int,Int}[], exponent=1.0)),\n)\n\nYou can provide this definition to Quasar.jl by updating the reference builtin_gates:\n\nusing Quasar\nQuasar.builtin_gates[] = my_builtin_gates","category":"section"},{"location":"pragmas/#Handling-pragmas","page":"Handling pragmas","title":"Handling pragmas","text":"OpenQASM3 allows you to define pragmas, which can be used to support operations like results besides measurements (e.g. expectation values), noise channels, or compiler directives.\n\nSince pragmas are by nature specific to the application, Quasar.jl doesn't provide support for parsing or visiting them. However, you can implement support for this in order to handle your specific pragmas. This will teach Quasar.jl how to incorporate your pragma instructions into the AST. You may want to use pragmas to support custom circuit operations (like noise channels) or result types (like expectation values).\n\nYou'll need to implement two functions: parse_pragma and visit_pragma.","category":"section"},{"location":"pragmas/#Parsing-pragmas-to-QasmExpressions","page":"Handling pragmas","title":"Parsing pragmas to QasmExpressions","text":"parse_pragma should accept four arguments:\n\ntokens – the list of tokens generated from tokenizing the raw OpenQASM 3.0 string\nstack – the current AST stack (used for error reporting)\nstart – the start location for the beginning of this pragma (used for error reporting)\nqasm – the raw QASM string (used for error reporting)\n\nThe tokens is a list of 3-tuples: the first item is an Int64 indicating the location in the qasm string of the start of the token, the second is an Int32 indicating the length of the token, and the third is a Token enum indicating the type of the token (e.g., a semicolon or an identifier).\n\nThe list of tokens provided to parse_pragma does not contain the leading pragma token, and contains only the tokens until the next newline. You're responsible for then walking through the line and generating appropriate QasmExpressions you'll visit later in visit_pragma. Your parse_pragma function should return a QasmExpression that has :pragma as its head. A skeleton of the function might be:\n\nfunction my_parse_pragma(tokens, stack, start, qasm)\n    pragma_expr = QasmExpression(:pragma)\n    while !isempty(tokens)\n        inner_expr = # do some lexing in here\n        push!(pragma_expr, inner_expr)\n    end\n    return pragma_expr\nend\n\nIf the submitted QASM has an invalid pragma, you can throw a Quasar.QasmParseError like so:\n\nyour_error_message = \"Oh no!

When Quasar.jl's visitor encounters a QasmExpression with a head of :pragma, it will call visit_pragma[](v::AbstractVisitor, expr::QasmExpression). You can then dispatch on the type of pragma, if you support multiple. You can then push CircuitInstructions and CircuitResults to the visitor v.","category":"section"},{"location":"pragmas/#Loading-your-functions-into-Quasar.jl","page":"Handling pragmas","title":"Loading your functions into Quasar.jl","text":"Similar to custom gate sets, you can let Quasar.jl know about these at module initialization time:\n\nfunction __init__()\n    Quasar.parse_pragma[] = my_parse_pragma\n    Quasar.vist_pragma[]  = my_visit_pragma\nend","category":"section"},{"location":"#Quasar","page":"Home","title":"Quasar","text":"Quasar.jl, the Qu(antum) as(sembly) (lex/pars)er, is a package for lexing and parsing the OpenQASM quantum assembly IR.\n\nQuasar works in a two-step fashion: first, it uses a tokenizer to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the quantum program, which is a nested structure of QasmExpressions.

This allows you to re-use the same AST multiple times for different inputs.\n\nOnce the visitor has walked the AST, its instructions field contains CircuitInstruction NamedTuples you can use to construct your own circuit instruction types. These tuples have fields:\n\ntype::String - the name of the instruction, e.g. \"measure\" or \"cx\"\narguments - any arguments the instruction accepts, such as an angle for an rx gate or a Period for a duration \ntargets::Vector{Int} - the qubits targeted by this instruction. This should include any control qubits. \ncontrols::Vector{Pair{Int,Int}} - any controls (including negctrl) applied to the instruction. The first item in the pair is the qubit, the second is the value controlled upon, so that 2=>0 represents a negctrl on qubit 2.\nexponent::Float64 - the pow modifier applied to the instruction, if any\n\nYou can use a package such as StructTypes.jl to build your circuits and programs from these named tuples.\n\nIn the above example, the h, x, and cx were defined in terms of the built-in gates U and gphase. In many cases, you may have an implementation of these gates that is simpler or more efficient. In that case, you can supply your own gate definition file using the include instruction, or provide a function to generate a dictionary of builtin gates to Quasar.jl:\n\nusing Quasar\n\nfunction my_builtin_generator()\n    ...\nend\n\nQuasar.builtin_gates[] = my_builtin_generator\n\nA generator function is used here in order to allow visitors to overwrite builtin functions in certain scopes without corrupting the reference definition.
